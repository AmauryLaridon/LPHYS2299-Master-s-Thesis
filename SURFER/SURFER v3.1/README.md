# SURFER v3.1
---

SURFER: a simple climate model linking CO2 emissions and Solar Radiation Management to sea level rise and ocean acidification.

For a full explanation of the model please check: https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2022/egusphere-2022-135/

We present the SURFER code and examples to reproduce all figures in the paper using a **jupyter notebook**: https://jupyter.org/.

### What is new in the version 3.1

- Tipping cascade module 
    - Interacting tipping elements connected to the temperature anomalies of the climate model
    - Contribution of the interacting tipping element to the radiative forcing in the climate model
    - Tipping elements modelized 
        - AMOC
        - GIS
        - WAIS
        - EASB
        - EAIS
