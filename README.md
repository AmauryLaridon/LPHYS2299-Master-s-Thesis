## What is the thesis about ? 

The **primary scientific research question** of this thesis is to **determine the impact of a realistic coupling between the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) on their cascading collapse dynamics.** To address this, the methodological challenge is to create a new simplified dynamic model using dynamical systems theory that can serve as an emulator based on complex hysteresis derived from process-based models. To study the responses of the AMOC and GIS under future emission scenarios, the *AMOC-GIS Tipping Cascade Calibration Model (AGTCCM) developed for this purpose is integrated into SURFER, a conceptual and partially process-based climate model with a coherent integration of the impact of an AMOC collapse on the carbon cycle. This latest version constitutes SURFER v3.2.

## What do the folders contain?

- *AMOC-DNL Model* contains a Python script developed by V. Couplet as part of his doctoral thesis and transmitted via personal communication. This script has been partially modified and used in the research for this thesis.

- *AMOC-GIS Tipping Module* includes scripts related to the development and implementation of the AGTCCM.

- *SURFER* holds various versions of SURFER used for this thesis, including version v3.2, which integrates AGTCCM with SURFER v3.1 through a coherent parameterization of the impact of AMOC collapse on the carbon cycle.

- *cGenie Simulations* contains scripts associated with the analysis of three AMOC hysteresis experiments conducted by J. GÃ©rard for this thesis.
