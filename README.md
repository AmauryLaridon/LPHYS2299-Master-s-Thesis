## What is the thesis about ? 

The primary scientific research question of this thesis is to determine the impact of a realistic coupling between the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) on their cascading collapse dynamics. To address this, the methodological challenge is to create a new simplified dynamic model using dynamical systems theory that can serve as an emulator based on complex hysteresis derived from process-based models.
