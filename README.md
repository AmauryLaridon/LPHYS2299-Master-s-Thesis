## What is the thesis about ? 

The **primary scientific research question** of this thesis is to **determine the impact of a realistic coupling between the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) on their cascading collapse dynamics.** To address this, the methodological challenge is to create a new simplified dynamic model using dynamical systems theory that can serve as an emulator based on complex hysteresis derived from process-based models. To study the responses of the AMOC and GIS under future emission scenarios, the *AMOC-GIS Tipping Cascade Calibration Model (AGTCCM) developed for this purpose is integrated into SURFER, a conceptual and partially process-based climate model with a coherent integration of the impact of an AMOC collapse on the carbon cycle. This latest version constitutes SURFER v3.2.
