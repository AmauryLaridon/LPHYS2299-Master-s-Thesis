## Why this repository ? 

cGenie is an EMIC that was used to conduct three AMOC hysteresis experiments to calibrate the AGTCCM in SURFER v3.2.

- The folder *jgerard simulations/* contains the configuration data for the two hosing experiments.

- The folder *Figures* contains all relevant figures generated in the analysis of simulation data.

- The folder *Documentation cGenie* contains the explanatory document for the cGenie model.

- The script *cGenie_exp_analysis.ipynb* is a Python script used to analyze simulation data and generate figures.
